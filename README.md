# CrowdStrike Workshop Tempalte

Welcome! This project provides scaffolding to making your own CrowdStrike workshop/coursebook. 

Development is done natively on GitHub with changes auto-populating on a GitBook landing site.

## Using CrowdStrike Workshop Curriculum

Our workshop curriculum is open source and free to use. This means anyone is welcome to work through the material at their own pace, even if they don't have a place on one of our instructor-led sessions.

If you do decide to use our material in your own resources please let us know! We'd love to hear about others benefiting from this content. This helps us get a sense for content impact, and feedback about what's working and would could be improved is invaluable.
