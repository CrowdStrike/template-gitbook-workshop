# Learning Objectives

## Single-page app

### Client rendering

- [ ] We can make `fetch` requests to our own server for JSON data
- [ ] We can render elements in the DOM based on the server data
- [ ] We can submit data to our own server, then update the DOM based on the response

### Error handling

- [ ] We can respond with useful error information to the client
- [ ] We can throw errors when our server hits a problem
- [ ] We can catch errors and log them correctly
- [ ] We can handle errors that occur in async code
- [ ] We can show the user useful messages based on server errors

## Design (UI/UX)

- [ ] We can account for all possible states of a network request
- [ ] We can design and create an accessible loading spinner

## Testing

- [ ] We can mock `fetch` calls in our tests to avoid hitting our real API
- [ ] We can test dynamic client-side interactions to ensure they behave as we expect
- [ ] We can test all of our error handling
