## Relational vs non-relational databases

What's the difference between relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases?

### Questions to consider

1. How is data structured in a SQL database? What about a NoSQL one?
1. What are some advantages of relational data? Are there disadvantages?

## Database security

How can we keep our data secure?

### Questions to consider

1. Why is it important for our production databases to have passwords that are kept secret?
1. What is SQL injection? How can it be used maliciously, and how do we guard against it?

## Schemas and relationships

How does a schema describe a relational database?

### Questions to consider

1. What kinds of data relationships are there?
1. What's a foreign key? How can they help us design schemas with relational data?

## Continuous Integration

How can we use GitHub Actions to automatically run our tests and deploy our code?

### Questions to consider

1. What is continuous integration (the methodology)? What is a continuous integration _server_?
1. Why might we want to run our tests whenever we push code to our repo?
