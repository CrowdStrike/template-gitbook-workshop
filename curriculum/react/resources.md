### React docs

Disclaimer: the offical docs haven't been re-written with the "new" (2 year old) hooks API, so you may see older syntax using classes in their example code. We recommend using this community-run fork with the same content translated to the new syntax:

There's a lot more to React than we could cover in a week. Definitely have a read through and see what else you can do.

The docs have a few good articles about general React philosophy:

- [Lifting State Up](https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/lifting-state-up.html)
- [Composition vs Inheritance](https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)
- [Thinking in React](https://reactwithhooks.netlify.app/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

## Videos

- [The Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) is what a lot of our Intro to the React API workshop was based on. It's great to quickly jump through to brush up on concepts.
- [React Class Component Patterns](https://courses.reacttraining.com/p/advanced-react-free) is a great short series of videos introducing some more advanced React patterns. It's a little older now (and uses the old class syntax) but the concepts are still very important.
- [Advanced Component Patterns](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns) goes into more depth about advanced React use.
