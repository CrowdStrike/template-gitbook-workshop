# Product handover guidelines

Here are some tips for how to conduct a successful product handover:

- Start with a basic demo of the app features conducted by the team
- Allow the PO a chance to click around and take a look
- Walk them through the readme / documentation / user manual that you have created for them
- Take note of any features that the PO mentions that they would love to build on top of the existing app (often good to add these to the readme or issues on Github)
- Take note of any existing bugs - log these in Github together
- Be clear that the build has ended and you are under no obligation to continue any development, including minor fixes/changes.

## Documentation

You should have a thorough README, and the product owner should receive documentation about anything that they are expected to take over once you finish. For example, they might need the login details for Heroku, as well as a short explanation of what it is and how they can access it.

## Further work

If you are interested in continuing to work with your PO in the future, there is sometimes an opportunity to do this. Let the PO know that they should contact the Course Facilitator if they secure funding for more development time to carry out further work on your team's MVP. If there is funding for further work, your team will get first refusal on it and we will provide you with guidance on how to approach the client relationship.
