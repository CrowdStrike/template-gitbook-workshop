# Course rules

## Arrive on time

Arrive **before scheduled start time**. If you're still in the kitchen making coffee when a workshop is supposed to begin you aren't on time, you're late. The mentors will not wait for everyone to be present before starting in the morning.

Let your cohort or the course facilitator know in advance if you're going to be away. Lots of people are freely giving their time and knowledge to make FAC possible and giving up other commitments to be here.

## Share the space

You are sharing a space with the rest of your cohort, the mentors, FAC staff and plenty of people working in Space4. Make sure you respect everyone else's right to have access to a clean tidy kitchen and bathroom.

Tidy up after yourself (at least!). Wash up your mugs and dishes straight away. Don't leave old food to go mouldy in the fridge. Clear your desk at the end of each day so it's ready for someone to use in the morning.

## Move around

Try to sit at a different desk each day. You'll usually be pairing with the person next to you; it's important to get experiencing working with everyone on the cohort.

## 20-minute rule

Struggle is good, but not too much of it. It's important to get used to not knowing how to do something, and to practice finding out for yourself (e.g. figuring it out with your pair or googling). If you cannot solve a problem within 20 minutes, then stop and ask a mentor for help.

## Extracurricular learning

Your course facilitator can connect anyone interested in revising together, based on specific material you would like to cover from any of the curriculum so far.

It's worth emphasising that there is no expectation to take on this extra work in your free time. Whilst there is clearly a benefit to revising on your own or with others, the course has been designed so that at the end of four months you will be an employable software developer. Founders and Coders has a very high success rate in this regard. This truly is possible working only during class time.

Please be kind to yourselves and prioritise your mental and physical health and well-being. You have a strong support network of mentors and FAC staff who you can lean on anytime for support.

## No frameworks

For the first 8 weeks of the course, we stick to vanilla JavaScript. That means no frontend frameworks like Bootstrap, jQuery and friends. We want you to build your fundamental skills before learning higher-level abstractions.

Understanding the basics will help you understand what problems frameworks were built to solve. This will let you make more effective judgements on which technologies to use in future. It will also give you the flexibility to switch between technologies, as the popularity of each one can shift.
