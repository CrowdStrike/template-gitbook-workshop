# Guidelines for coaching sessions

All participants are encouraged to read these notes.

## General structure

1. Sessions are generally 90 minutes long;
2. With complete beginners, start with a group of two
3. The maximum group size is four

## Guidelines for learners

1. Be patient
2. Believe in yourself

## Guidelines for facilitators

1. If in doubt, keep quiet and let the group do the work
2. Be humble

### The 3 R's: Roles, rounds, reflection

Find ways to keep every member of the group involved and to discourage any one member of the group from dominating the discussion.

1. **Roles** Within each group activity, give each group member a distinct role
2. **Rounds** Between each activity, rotate the roles
3. **Reflection** Set aside time for review at the end of each activity

The main benefit of this role-based approach is that nobody gets to dominate the space, everybody gets a turn to express themselves, the group is always in communication, and the group does most of the work—not the facilitator.

### Groups of two

1. Driver: shares their screen and follows the instructions of the navigator;
2. Navigator: instructs the driver what to type.

In a group of two—perhaps beginners at pairing—the facilitator may start by being quite active, but as much as possible the two learners should be given the opportunity to work together without too much intervention.

The facilitator needs to make sure that both participants understand their roles. At the beginning of the session, the facilitator can define the roles and then ask the learners to describe their respective roles in turn, to make sure that they both understand.

The Driver starts by sharing their screen. The Navigator reads out the problem, as it appears on the Driver's screen, and both learners can then discuss the problem before proceeding.

The Driver should be gently dissuaded from taking the initiative; the Navigator should be encouraged to keep thinking aloud and consulting with the Driver when needed.

Once a problem has been solved, both learners should be given an opportunity to ask questions about the solution or offer alternative solutions before the facilitator feeds back their reflections to the group.

In a group of two, each round should be no longer than 40 minutes, even if a problem remains unsolved, to allow each group member to have an equal amount of time in each role.

### Groups of three

The facilitator can introduce a new role:

3. Research assistant

In a three-person group, the Driver should take an even more passive role and the Navigator should direct their dialogue about the problem to their Research assistant, who is also free to search online for answers. The Driver can relax and let the other two group members do the work—unless they are asked for input.

After a problem has been solved, the Driver will then have an opportunity to ask questions about the solution, to offer alternative solutions, and to offer their reflections to the group, a role that in a less-experienced, two-person group would be played by the facilitator.

The idea with a three-person group is for the group members to take it in turns to play the role of the facilitator, and this role is played by the—otherwise passive—Driver.

With a less experienced group, the facilitator is likely to need still to provide a good deal of support and guidance, but they should not intervene unless the group members fall out of role, get stuck or have missed something significant even after the Driver has had a chance to offer their reflections.

In a group of three, each round might last for 25 minutes, to allow each group member to have an equal amount of time in each role, but this is only a broad rule of thumb and need not be adhered to if the group is clearly in flow solving a problem together. Groups of three are generally less appropriate for complete beginners.

### Groups of four

4. Observer

With a four-person group the "reflective" and "driving" roles can be separated, so that the Driver just does the typing, only helping out when requested, while the end-of-problem reflections are led by the Observer.

In a group of four, it may not be possible for each group member to get a chance to play every role within a single session.

### Ongoing groups

Initially, the problems should be determined by where each of the learners is in their own learning, but ongoing groups should be at a broadly similar level and the facilitator may, if they choose, decide the problems that the group will work on, based on their understanding of the group's needs.

Problems that the group work on may be quite short, in which case group members may get a chance to play all the different roles in a single session. Otherwise, they can switch roles between sessions and the Facilitator will need to make sure that the group keeps track between sessions.

The group can be encouraged to set collective goals for self-study. If, after the end of four weeks, a gap has opened up in the progress of the learners, the group can be dissolved and the learners can join different groups more appropriate to their respective needs.

As a group progresses, they may be able to meet without the Facilitator present.

## Developing a framework for problem solving

The role of the facilitator is to gently and repeatedly nudge learners towards ways of thinking that will help, and away from ways of thinking that will hurt, the development of their problem-solving skills.

Complete beginners may fall into any of the following patterns:

- Failing to read the problem description properly before proceeding;
- Not looking at the skeleton code provided to understand the overall shape of the solution;
- Not thinking in terms of what both the inputs and outputs are going to look like;
- Not making an initial attempt to tackle a small part of the problem to help them understand the whole, such as by making a single test pass, perhaps with a hard-coded return value;
- Attempting to code all of the solution at once before sufficiently understanding any part of it;
- Not making a bullet-point list of the steps required before trying to code all of the solution;
- Not identifying the parts of the problem description that could be used to start work on that list of steps;
- Not being deliberate enough in translating the steps into code, one step at a time;
- Not reading and trying to reason about the error messages when running the code;
- Not attempting to tackle the problem one test at a time ("red, green, refactor");
- Not having any sense of what functions they might be able to use to solve the problem;
- Not making appropriate use of a search engine;
- Just out-and-out guessing without any sense of what they are doing.

When the facilitator observes these behaviours and they are not corrected by the learners themselves, they can intervene with suggestive questions, starting with phrases like, *"Have you thought about...?"* or as a group gets more experienced, *"What step do you think we could take now to solve this problem?"* or *"Are we forgetting to do something here?"* or *"Do you remember what we did at this stage on the last problem we worked on together?"* or *"What other approaches could we take at this point?"*.

Only with complete beginners or where the group has become obviously stuck, should the facilitator consider being explicit with a solution, with a phrase like,*"Have you thought about...?"*. Using this sort of language will make it easier for other members of the group to begin to facilitate the problem-solving process, even when they themselves are unsure of the answer. If also allows the facilitator to continue to play a useful role in the group even when they are not sure of how they would solve a problem.

## Advice to a complete beginner

Learning to code is in some ways similar to learning a new spoken language. In other words, for most people it is more important to get practice doing it and to be prepared to continually make mistakes and sometimes to be corrected or to have to look a word of phrase up (for the umpteenth time) than to actually "know" or "understand" fully what they are saying or typing.

With complete novices, there is a tendency to be scared of pressing ahead if they don't feel they understand what they are doing or, conversely, just to blindly stumble ahead in the hope that what they are typing will somehow make sense. Intuition plays an important role in programming, but it takes patience and perseverance to develop it.

There is a place that learners usually arrive at after a while where they stop worrying so much about not "understanding" the whole and they can begin to trust their intuition a bit more. They get better at reading the problem, translating the instructions into steps, reasoning about what they are doing, intuiting possible solutions, and knowing when and how to use a search engine.

This is the place that a beginner has to get to to provide a platform for further learning. The knowledge and intuition comes incrementally over time. Even experienced developers will look things up several times a day. That is where learning to program differs from mastery of a spoken language. Experts are not necessarily expected to remember all of the language features that they use.
