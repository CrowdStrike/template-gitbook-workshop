# Project

Each week, you will be split into teams of 4 by your mentors. These teams will be changed four times during the first half of the course, to give you a chance to work with every other member of your cohort.

The teams stay together for the following weeks:

- First team = week 1
- Second team = weeks 2&3
- Third team = week 4
- Fourth team = weeks 5&6
- Fifth team = week 7&8

Your teams are posted on the wall by the door or can be found in your cohort's London Programme folder. Have a chat with your team when it first forms, and come up with a team name.

## Creating repositories for each project

When you create repositories for your weekly projects, please follow this naming convention:  
`week1-<name of team1>`  
`week1-<name of team2>`  
`week1-<name of team3>`  
`week1-<name of team4>`

`week2-<name of team1>`  
`week2-<name of team2>`  
`week2-<name of team3>`  
`week2-<name of team4>`

etc.

This will make it much easier to find your projects in future.

Aside from these repositories, the organisation is yours and you are free to add whatever you would like inside.

## Project Presentation

Your timetable includes 45 mins for your team to write your presentation and discuss how you are going to present your project together.
**Remember: We want to hear from everyone during your presentation!**

Each team then has 12 minutes to present, with 5 additional minutes for questions. We will be strict with you on timing, so make sure you use your time effectively.

### Structure

1. Show your process:
   - Talk through the Why, What, How of your project
   - How did you split up the work?
   - How did you choose to pair?
2. Briefly demo your project and explain how it conforms to your brief i.e. the user stories
3. Show your project board and (from Week 2) report on estimated vs actual velocity
4. Walk us through your code. Emphasise the things you learned that were new to you, which the rest of your cohort could benefit from hearing about:
   - something you're proud of
   - something that you found really hard / struggled with
5. Have the people who didn't write a piece of code talk through it - this is a great way to demonstrate knowledge of learning and collaboration
6. Avoid talking through the project brief for a long time - each team has the same brief and your time will be better spent talking about what was unique about your presentation

### Make it interactive

- **Ask your audience questions** and keep them on their toes.
- You could even introduce a quiz element to your presentation. Check out [Kahoot!](https://kahoot.com)

### ... and use gifs :tada:

- Jazz it up with emojis, images and [gifs](https://giphy.com)!
