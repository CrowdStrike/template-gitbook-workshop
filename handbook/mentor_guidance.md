# Mentoring at Founders and Coders
## A guide to leading and supporting peer learning using [our coursebook](https://founders-and-coders.gitbook.io/coursebook/)

_This is a live document that mentors are encouraged to feedback on._

Please read these notes and check with the course facilitator before your week starts with any clarifications, questions and/or thoughts.

## To do before your week
- Make sure you’re an owner of the cohort's GitHub organisation.
- Decide who wants to be Zoom 'host' each day (for putting pairs in rooms).
- Decide who will lead which bits of your week - your presentations, project & spike intro, design burst and workshops.
- Read your week's workshops and solutions, as well as learning objectives.
- Check in with the course facilitator for anything, before, during or after your week.
- Have a look at the cohort's most recent projects, read their most recent SGC in `GitHub` > `fac#` > `cohort` > `retrospective` > `week-x.md`.
- Read their cohort expectations at `GitHub` > `fac#` > `cohort` > `expectations.md`.

## Being a good mentor
- This is their classroom (Zoom, their Slack channel, Space4). Please be respectful of their space and time.
- Making offhand announcements like “it’s going to get a lot tougher” or “this will be super easy in a few weeks” builds unnecessary expectations based on your own experience. Do your best to frame it as your experience, and only when asked directly about it.
- Avoid saying "you'll learn that later" or "this will be useless once you learn x". And avoid offering negative opinions about any material covered during your week - your job is to present the curriculum and allow them to come to their own conclusions.
- When someone brings you a problem, ask questions before giving an answer. It's better if you can empower them to find that answer within themselves rather than giving it to them.
  - Consider asking them to take a step back and explain *why* they are trying to do a certain thing (rather than *how*). This will ensure they're focussing on the problem and not their solution.
  - Have you asked the other members of your team?
  - Have you asked anyone from other teams? [If you know a team that has worked through the same problem, point them to that team]
  - What did you google for?
- Respond positively to questions. Asking questions is scary, so help people to feel comfortable and try to encourage that behaviour.
- They should always be in control of the keyboard and mouse (don’t type for them). Very occassionally, you might need to write something (e.g. pseudo code). Avoid temptation by using a notepad / Zoom chat.
- Draw things out! Keep a notepad and pen with you and prepare yourself to draw out the problems/solutions to visually aid your explanations.
- If you don’t know the answer that is completely okay! Be honest about not knowing. The best thing to do is find out the answer with the other person. Google it and then you can both learn something new. Ideally this also signals to the person you are mentoring that it is okay not to know something.
- Help break big problems down into small ones, especially if they seem like they're feeling overwhelmed. They need to be shown they can figure it out on their own, you are just there to guide them. Write down the steps & encourage them just to focus on one step at a time.
- Let them stumble. We learn by making mistakes, getting frustrated, and working through a problem in our own way. Be supportive, and encourage them to explore.
- Don't say no when you think they are not doing something right - and be open to the fact that their way could also be right. Be gentle, approach it in a thoughtful way. You can try asking them to explain the steps that they're taking. If you give them the answer, you're taking away an opportunity for them to learn.
- Work collaboratively with the cohort. If you have two or more people, you should work with all of them. Don't focus all your attention on one of them. Encourage those who have figured it out first to then show this to the others.

Note: People may be frustrated with you, especially at the beginning of the course, because they may assume you are here as a teacher that can always provide answers. You can clarify that your role as mentor is to work through problems together.

## Timings
You are ultimately responsible for timings, which will be up to date in the course schedule before your week. As Zoom host, you can broadcast messages (e.g. “Rooms closing in 60 seconds”), and close rooms - which starts the 60 second timer. The clearer and sharper you are with timings, the happier everyone will be. Please try not to compromise timings during the week, e.g. shortening SGCs, since each part is important for different reasons.

## Breaks
Make sure the cohort is getting regular breaks, from their screens and chairs. When you come back together after a workshop, suggest 3-5 minutes to turn off their video, stretch, go for a walk, get water, etc.

## You presenting
You will be introducing the week at 10am Monday on your week's topic. As this will be their first impression of you, please do make sure you’ve read the slides ahead of time to know who is going to cover what and in how much detail. If you fancy adding sparkle, consider a Kahoot or informal quiz at the end of your talk.

Monday afternoon you will introduce the week’s projects - starting with learning outcomes for the week (only need to read those that are highlighted), and then going through user stories, assessment criteria and stretch goals. This also frames the spikes, and so you will also cover each of the four topics, before putting project teams in Zoom rooms so they can each decide which topic they’ll take. Then back in the main room you can shout out each topic and they can tell you their names for each one.

Same for design bursts.

## Them presenting
On Tuesdays they present their technical spike to the group - start promptly at 10.10am and try your best to allow them 8 minutes of presenting and no more than 12 minutes total incl questions. Also think up some questions in case no one has any. Prioritise questions from people who may not always ask questions, your CF can help with this in preparation for your week.

They will also present their projects on Friday, these will be 12 minutes each and no more than 18 minutes total incl questions.

All that being said, allow extra time for technical difficulties.

## Workshops
Read the workshop and solution(s) ahead of time, and think about how you would like to present the workshop given what is already there.

Talk through the workshop with enough detail that they have everything they need to start, and don’t front-load your workshops with information. It can be tempting to explain everything, but going into much detail won’t help them learn by doing. Once people have been in their rooms for 5 minutes make your way around one by one, checking how they’re getting on - let them know you’re going to do this before putting them in breakout rooms. They’re keen to get started and it’s easier for you to let them.

You will put them in pairs for workshops according to a pre-made pairing rota at `fac20` > `cohort` > `pairs-and-teams` > `workshop-pairs.md`, and be on hand to support them whilst they work through the material. 

Give at least fifteen minutes at the end of each workshop for going through solutions, and you should split the pairs across two rooms - e.g. by putting all the odd break out rooms in room 1 and even breakout rooms in room 2. Please select people at random rather than ask for volunteers, answering questions, having a discussion. Please make a note of what questions are asked as we are building a FAQ for each workshop. Do your best to get one person from each pair to contribute something.

Make time on Thursday to go back through each workshop from Monday to Wednesday and raise issues (or pull requests!) from your first hand feedback.

## Code reviewing
Make sure you have finished reviewing their code before 11am on Friday. Be complimentary, keep it focused around the acceptance criteria and learning objectives for the week, of course highlighting improved ways of writing code, especially concerning topics covered in previous weeks. Ideally keep it brief and where appropriate link to resources (MDN, W3, etc). You will review two weeks: your week and the week after.
